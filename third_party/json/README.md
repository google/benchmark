## Design goals

There are myriads of [JSON](http://json.org) libraries out there, and each may even have its reason to exist. Our class had these design goals:

- **Intuitive syntax**. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the [examples below](#examples) and you'll know what I mean.

- **Trivial integration**. Our whole code consists of a single header file [`json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/src/json.hpp). That's it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings.

- **Serious testing**. Our class is heavily [unit-tested](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/test/src/unit.cpp) and covers [100%](https://coveralls.io/r/nlohmann/json) of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) that there are no memory leaks. To maintain high quality, the project is following the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/289).

Other aspects were not so important to us:

- **Memory efficiency**. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: `std::string` for strings, `int64_t`, `uint64_t` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector` for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class `basic_json` to your needs.

- **Speed**. There are certainly [faster JSON libraries](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark#parsing-time) out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding JSON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a `std::vector` or `std::map`, you are already set.

See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#please-dont) for more information.


## Integration

The single required source, file `json.hpp` is in the `src` directory or [released here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases). All you need to do is add

```cpp
#include "json.hpp"

// for convenience
using json = nlohmann::json;
```

to the files you want to use JSON objects. That's it. Do not forget to set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., `-std=c++11` for GCC and Clang).

:beer: If you are using OS X and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), just type `brew tap nlohmann/json` and `brew install nlohmann_json` and you're set. If you want the bleeding edge rather than the latest release, use `brew install nlohmann_json --HEAD`.

If you are using the [Meson Build System](http://mesonbuild.com), then you can wrap this repo as a subproject.

If you are using [Conan](https://www.conan.io/) to manage your dependencies, merely add `jsonformoderncpp/x.y.z@vthiery/stable` to your `conanfile.py`'s requires, where `x.y.z` is the release version you want to use. Please file issues [here](https://github.com/vthiery/conan-jsonformoderncpp/issues) if you experience problems with the packages.

If you are using [hunter](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/) on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the [nlohmann_json package](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/packages/pkg/nlohmann_json.html). Please see the hunter project for any issues regarding the packaging.

If you are using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) on your project for external dependencies, then you can use the [nlohmann-json package](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/nlohmann-json). Please see the vcpkg project for any issues regarding the packaging.


## Examples

Beside the examples below, you may want to check the [documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/) where each function contains a separate code example (e.g., check out [`emplace()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a5338e282d1d02bed389d852dd670d98d.html#a5338e282d1d02bed389d852dd670d98d)). All [example files](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/doc/examples) can be compiled and executed on their own (e.g., file [emplace.cpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/doc/examples/emplace.cpp)).

### JSON as first-class data type

Here are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.

Assume you want to create the JSON object

```json
{
  "pi": 3.141,
  "happy": true,
  "name": "Niels",
  "nothing": null,
  "answer": {
    "everything": 42
  },
  "list": [1, 0, 2],
  "object": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": 42.99
  }
}
```

With the JSON class, you could write:

```cpp
// create an empty structure (null)
json j;

// add a number that is stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object)
j["pi"] = 3.141;

// add a Boolean that is stored as bool
j["happy"] = true;

// add a string that is stored as std::string
j["name"] = "Niels";

// add another null object by passing nullptr
j["nothing"] = nullptr;

// add an object inside the object
j["answer"]["everything"] = 42;

// add an array that is stored as std::vector (using an initializer list)
j["list"] = { 1, 0, 2 };

// add another object (using an initializer list of pairs)
j["object"] = { {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} };

// instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above)
json j2 = {
  {"pi", 3.141},
  {"happy", true},
  {"name", "Niels"},
  {"nothing", nullptr},
  {"answer", {
    {"everything", 42}
  }},
  {"list", {1, 0, 2}},
  {"object", {
    {"currency", "USD"},
    {"value", 42.99}
  }}
};
```

Note that in all these cases, you never need to "tell" the compiler which JSON value you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions `json::array` and `json::object` will help:

```cpp
// a way to express the empty array []
json empty_array_explicit = json::array();

// ways to express the empty object {}
json empty_object_implicit = json({});
json empty_object_explicit = json::object();

// a way to express an _array_ of key/value pairs [["currency", "USD"], ["value", 42.99]]
json array_not_object = json::array({ {"currency", "USD"}, {"value", 42.99} });
```


### Serialization / Deserialization

#### To/from strings

You can create an object (deserialization) by appending `_json` to a string literal:

```cpp
// create object from string literal
json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"_json;

// or even nicer with a raw string literal
auto j2 = R"(
  {
    "happy": true,
    "pi": 3.141
  }
)"_json;
```

Note that without appending the `_json` suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as JSON string value. That is, `json j = "{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }"` would just store the string `"{ "happy": true, "pi": 3.141 }"` rather than parsing the actual object.

The above example can also be expressed explicitly using `json::parse()`:

```cpp
// parse explicitly
auto j3 = json::parse("{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }");
```

You can also get a string representation (serialize):

```cpp
// explicit conversion to string
std::string s = j.dump();    // {\"happy\":true,\"pi\":3.141}

// serialization with pretty printing
// pass in the amount of spaces to indent
std::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl;
// {
//     "happy": true,
//     "pi": 3.141
// }
```

Note the difference between serialization and assignment:

```cpp
// store a string in a JSON value
json j_string = "this is a string";

// retrieve the string value (implicit JSON to std::string conversion)
std::string cpp_string = j_string;
// retrieve the string value (explicit JSON to std::string conversion)
auto cpp_string2 = j_string.get<std::string>();

// retrieve the serialized value (explicit JSON serialization)
std::string serialized_string = j_string.dump();

// output of original string
std::cout << cpp_string << " == " << cpp_string2 << " == " << j_string.get<std::string>() << '\n';
// output of serialized value
std::cout << j_string << " == " << serialized_string << std::endl;
```

`.dump()` always returns the serialized value, and `.get<std::string>()` returns the originally stored string value.


#### To/from streams (e.g. files, string streams)

You can also use streams to serialize and deserialize:

```cpp
// deserialize from standard input
json j;
std::cin >> j;

// serialize to standard output
std::cout << j;

// the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing
std::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;
```

These operators work for any subclasses of `std::istream` or `std::ostream`. Here is the same example with files:

```cpp
// read a JSON file
std::ifstream i("file.json");
json j;
i >> j;

// write prettified JSON to another file
std::ofstream o("pretty.json");
o << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;
```

Please note that setting the exception bit for `failbit` is inappropriate for this use case. It will result in program termination due to the `noexcept` specifier in use.

#### Read from iterator range

You can also read JSON from an iterator range; that is, from any container accessible by iterators whose content is stored as contiguous byte sequence, for instance a `std::vector<std::uint8_t>`:

```cpp
std::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {'t', 'r', 'u', 'e'};
json j = json::parse(v.begin(), v.end());
```

You may leave the iterators for the range [begin, end):

```cpp
std::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {'t', 'r', 'u', 'e'};
json j = json::parse(v);
```


### STL-like access

We designed the JSON class to behave just like an STL container. In fact, it satisfies the [**ReversibleContainer**](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/ReversibleContainer) requirement.

```cpp
// create an array using push_back
json j;
j.push_back("foo");
j.push_back(1);
j.push_back(true);

// also use emplace_back
j.emplace_back(1.78);

// iterate the array
for (json::iterator it = j.begin(); it != j.end(); ++it) {
  std::cout << *it << '\n';
}

// range-based for
for (auto& element : j) {
  std::cout << element << '\n';
}

// getter/setter
const std::string tmp = j[0];
j[1] = 42;
bool foo = j.at(2);

// comparison
j == "[\"foo\", 1, true]"_json;  // true

// other stuff
j.size();     // 3 entries
j.empty();    // false
j.type();     // json::value_t::array
j.clear();    // the array is empty again

// convenience type checkers
j.is_null();
j.is_boolean();
j.is_number();
j.is_object();
j.is_array();
j.is_string();

// create an object
json o;
o["foo"] = 23;
o["bar"] = false;
o["baz"] = 3.141;

// also use emplace
o.emplace("weather", "sunny");

// special iterator member functions for objects
for (json::iterator it = o.begin(); it != o.end(); ++it) {
  std::cout << it.key() << " : " << it.value() << "\n";
}

// find an entry
if (o.find("foo") != o.end()) {
  // there is an entry with key "foo"
}

// or simpler using count()
int foo_present = o.count("foo"); // 1
int fob_present = o.count("fob"); // 0

// delete an entry
o.erase("foo");
```


### Conversion from STL containers

Any sequence container (`std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::forward_list`, `std::list`) whose values can be used to construct JSON types (e.g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again STL containers described in this section) can be used to create a JSON array. The same holds for similar associative containers (`std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multiset`), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends on how the elements are ordered in the respective STL container.

```cpp
std::vector<int> c_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};
json j_vec(c_vector);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]

std::deque<double> c_deque {1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6};
json j_deque(c_deque);
// [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6]

std::list<bool> c_list {true, true, false, true};
json j_list(c_list);
// [true, true, false, true]

std::forward_list<int64_t> c_flist {12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543};
json j_flist(c_flist);
// [12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543]

std::array<unsigned long, 4> c_array {{1, 2, 3, 4}};
json j_array(c_array);
// [1, 2, 3, 4]

std::set<std::string> c_set {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};
json j_set(c_set); // only one entry for "one" is used
// ["four", "one", "three", "two"]

std::unordered_set<std::string> c_uset {"one", "two", "three", "four", "one"};
json j_uset(c_uset); // only one entry for "one" is used
// maybe ["two", "three", "four", "one"]

std::multiset<std::string> c_mset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};
json j_mset(c_mset); // both entries for "one" are used
// maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"]

std::unordered_multiset<std::string> c_umset {"one", "two", "one", "four"};
json j_umset(c_umset); // both entries for "one" are used
// maybe ["one", "two", "one", "four"]
```

Likewise, any associative key-value containers (`std::map`, `std::multimap`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`) whose keys can construct an `std::string` and whose values can be used to construct JSON types (see examples above) can be used to create a JSON object. Note that in case of multimaps only one key is used in the JSON object and the value depends on the internal order of the STL container.

```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> c_map { {"one", 1}, {"two", 2}, {"three", 3} };
json j_map(c_map);
// {"one": 1, "three": 3, "two": 2 }

std::unordered_map<const char*, double> c_umap { {"one", 1.2}, {"two", 2.3}, {"three", 3.4} };
json j_umap(c_umap);
// {"one": 1.2, "two": 2.3, "three": 3.4}

std::multimap<std::string, bool> c_mmap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };
json j_mmap(c_mmap); // only one entry for key "three" is used
// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}

std::unordered_multimap<std::string, bool> c_ummap { {"one", true}, {"two", true}, {"three", false}, {"three", true} };
json j_ummap(c_ummap); // only one entry for key "three" is used
// maybe {"one": true, "two": true, "three": true}
```

### JSON Pointer and JSON Patch

The library supports **JSON Pointer** ([RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)) as alternative means to address structured values. On top of this, **JSON Patch** ([RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)) allows to describe differences between two JSON values - effectively allowing patch and diff operations known from Unix.

```cpp
// a JSON value
json j_original = R"({
  "baz": ["one", "two", "three"],
  "foo": "bar"
})"_json;

// access members with a JSON pointer (RFC 6901)
j_original["/baz/1"_json_pointer];
// "two"

// a JSON patch (RFC 6902)
json j_patch = R"([
  { "op": "replace", "path": "/baz", "value": "boo" },
  { "op": "add", "path": "/hello", "value": ["world"] },
  { "op": "remove", "path": "/foo"}
])"_json;

// apply the patch
json j_result = j_original.patch(j_patch);
// {
//    "baz": "boo",
//    "hello": ["world"]
// }

// calculate a JSON patch from two JSON values
json::diff(j_result, j_original);
// [
//   { "op":" replace", "path": "/baz", "value": ["one", "two", "three"] },
//   { "op": "remove","path": "/hello" },
//   { "op": "add", "path": "/foo", "value": "bar" }
// ]
```


### Implicit conversions

The type of the JSON object is determined automatically by the expression to store. Likewise, the stored value is implicitly converted.

```cpp
// strings
std::string s1 = "Hello, world!";
json js = s1;
std::string s2 = js;

// Booleans
bool b1 = true;
json jb = b1;
bool b2 = jb;

// numbers
int i = 42;
json jn = i;
double f = jn;

// etc.
```

You can also explicitly ask for the value:

```cpp
std::string vs = js.get<std::string>();
bool vb = jb.get<bool>();
int vi = jn.get<int>();

// etc.
```

### Arbitrary types conversions

Every type can be serialized in JSON, not just STL-containers and scalar types. Usually, you would do something along those lines:

```cpp
namespace ns {
    // a simple struct to model a person
    struct person {
        std::string name;
        std::string address;
        int age;
    };
}

ns::person p = {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60};

// convert to JSON: copy each value into the JSON object
json j;
j["name"] = p.name;
j["address"] = p.address;
j["age"] = p.age;

// ...

// convert from JSON: copy each value from the JSON object
ns::person p {
    j["name"].get<std::string>(),
    j["address"].get<std::string>(),
    j["age"].get<int>()
};
```

It works, but that's quite a lot of boilerplate... Fortunately, there's a better way:

```cpp
// create a person
ns::person p {"Ned Flanders", "744 Evergreen Terrace", 60};

// conversion: person -> json
json j = p;

std::cout << j << std::endl;
// {"address":"744 Evergreen Terrace","age":60,"name":"Ned Flanders"}

// conversion: json -> person
ns::person p2 = j;

// that's it
assert(p == p2);
```

#### Basic usage

To make this work with one of your types, you only need to provide two functions:

```cpp
using nlohmann::json;

namespace ns {
    void to_json(json& j, const person& p) {
        j = json{{"name", p.name}, {"address", p.address}, {"age", p.age}};
    }

    void from_json(const json& j, person& p) {
        p.name = j.at("name").get<std::string>();
        p.address = j.at("address").get<std::string>();
        p.age = j.at("age").get<int>();
    }
} // namespace ns
```

That's all! When calling the `json` constructor with your type, your custom `to_json` method will be automatically called.
Likewise, when calling `get<your_type>()`, the `from_json` method will be called.

Some important things:

* Those methods **MUST** be in your type's namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate them (in this example, they are in namespace `ns`, where `person` is defined).
* When using `get<your_type>()`, `your_type` **MUST** be [DefaultConstructible](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/DefaultConstructible). (There is a way to bypass this requirement described later.)
* In function `from_json`, use function [`at()`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c.html#a93403e803947b86f4da2d1fb3345cf2c) to access the object values rather than `operator[]`. In case a key does not exist, `at` throws an exception that you can handle, whereas `operator[]` exhibits undefined behavior.
* In case your type contains several `operator=` definitions, code like `your_variable = your_json;` [may not compile](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/667). You need to write `your_variable = your_json.get<decltype your_variable>();` instead.
* You do not need to add serializers or deserializers for STL types like `std::vector`: the library already implements these.
* Be careful with the definition order of the `from_json`/`to_json` functions: If a type `B` has a member of type `A`, you **MUST** define `to_json(A)` before `to_json(B)`. Look at [issue 561](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/561) for more details.


#### How do I convert third-party types?

This requires a bit more advanced technique. But first, let's see how this conversion mechanism works:

The library uses **JSON Serializers** to convert types to json.
The default serializer for `nlohmann::json` is `nlohmann::adl_serializer` (ADL means [Argument-Dependent Lookup](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl)).

It is implemented like this (simplified):

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct adl_serializer {
    static void to_json(json& j, const T& value) {
        // calls the "to_json" method in T's namespace
    }

    static void from_json(const json& j, T& value) {
        // same thing, but with the "from_json" method
    }
};
```

This serializer works fine when you have control over the type's namespace. However, what about `boost::optional`, or `std::filesystem::path` (C++17)? Hijacking the `boost` namespace is pretty bad, and it's illegal to add something other than template specializations to `std`...

To solve this, you need to add a specialization of `adl_serializer` to the `nlohmann` namespace, here's an example:

```cpp
// partial specialization (full specialization works too)
namespace nlohmann {
    template <typename T>
    struct adl_serializer<boost::optional<T>> {
        static void to_json(json& j, const boost::optional<T>& opt) {
            if (opt == boost::none) {
                j = nullptr;
            } else {
              j = *opt; // this will call adl_serializer<T>::to_json which will
                        // find the free function to_json in T's namespace!
            }
        }

        static void from_json(const json& j, boost::optional<T>& opt) {
            if (j.is_null()) {
                opt = boost::none;
            } else {
                opt = j.get<T>(); // same as above, but with 
                                  // adl_serializer<T>::from_json
            }
        }
    };
}
```

#### How can I use `get()` for non-default constructible/non-copyable types?

There is a way, if your type is [MoveConstructible](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/MoveConstructible). You will need to specialize the `adl_serializer` as well, but with a special `from_json` overload:

```cpp
struct move_only_type {
    move_only_type() = delete;
    move_only_type(int ii): i(ii) {}
    move_only_type(const move_only_type&) = delete;
    move_only_type(move_only_type&&) = default;
    
    int i;
};

namespace nlohmann {
    template <>
    struct adl_serializer<move_only_type> {
        // note: the return type is no longer 'void', and the method only takes
        // one argument
        static move_only_type from_json(const json& j) {
            return {j.get<int>()};
        }
        
        // Here's the catch! You must provide a to_json method! Otherwise you
        // will not be able to convert move_only_type to json, since you fully
        // specialized adl_serializer on that type
        static void to_json(json& j, move_only_type t) {
            j = t.i;
        }
    };
}
```

#### Can I write my own serializer? (Advanced use)

Yes. You might want to take a look at [`unit-udt.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/test/src/unit-udt.cpp) in the test suite, to see a few examples.

If you write your own serializer, you'll need to do a few things:

* use a different `basic_json` alias than `nlohmann::json` (the last template parameter of `basic_json` is the `JSONSerializer`)
* use your `basic_json` alias (or a template parameter) in all your `to_json`/`from_json` methods
* use `nlohmann::to_json` and `nlohmann::from_json` when you need ADL

Here is an example, without simplifications, that only accepts types with a size <= 32, and uses ADL.

```cpp
// You should use void as a second template argument
// if you don't need compile-time checks on T
template<typename T, typename SFINAE = typename std::enable_if<sizeof(T) <= 32>::type>
struct less_than_32_serializer {
    template <typename BasicJsonType>
    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, T value) {
        // we want to use ADL, and call the correct to_json overload
        using nlohmann::to_json; // this method is called by adl_serializer,
                                 // this is where the magic happens
        to_json(j, value);
    }
    
    template <typename BasicJsonType>
    static void from_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {
        // same thing here
        using nlohmann::from_json;
        from_json(j, value);
    }
};
```

Be **very** careful when reimplementing your serializer, you can stack overflow if you don't pay attention:

```cpp
template <typename T, void>
struct bad_serializer
{
    template <typename BasicJsonType>
    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, const T& value) {
      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::to_json(j, value);
      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!
      j = value;
    }
    
    template <typename BasicJsonType>
    static void to_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {
      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::from_json(j, value);
      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!
      value = j.template get<T>(); // oops!
    }
};
```

### Binary formats (CBOR and MessagePack)

Though JSON is a ubiquitous data format, it is not a very compact format suitable for data exchange, for instance over a network. Hence, the library supports [CBOR](http://cbor.io) (Concise Binary Object Representation) and [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org) to efficiently encode JSON values to byte vectors and to decode such vectors.

```cpp
// create a JSON value
json j = R"({"compact": true, "schema": 0})"_json;

// serialize to CBOR
std::vector<std::uint8_t> v_cbor = json::to_cbor(j);

// 0xa2, 0x67, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x6d, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xf5, 0x66, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6d, 0x61, 0x00

// roundtrip
json j_from_cbor = json::from_cbor(v_cbor);

// serialize to MessagePack
std::vector<std::uint8_t> v_msgpack = json::to_msgpack(j);

// 0x82, 0xa7, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x6d, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xc3, 0xa6, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6d, 0x61, 0x00

// roundtrip
json j_from_msgpack = json::from_msgpack(v_msgpack);
```


## Supported compilers

Though it's 2017 already, the support for C++11 is still a bit sparse. Currently, the following compilers are known to work:

- GCC 4.9 - 7.2 (and possibly later)
- Clang 3.4 - 5.0 (and possibly later)
- Intel C++ Compiler 17.0.2 (and possibly later)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 / Build Tools 14.0.25123.0 (and possibly later)
- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 / Build Tools 15.5.180.51428 (and possibly later)

I would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions.

Please note:

- GCC 4.8 does not work because of two bugs ([55817](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55817) and [57824](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57824)) in the C++11 support. Note there is a [pull request](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/212) to fix some of the issues.
- Android defaults to using very old compilers and C++ libraries. To fix this, add the following to your `Application.mk`. This will switch to the LLVM C++ library, the Clang compiler, and enable C++11 and other features disabled by default.
 
    ```
    APP_STL := c++_shared
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := clang3.6
    APP_CPPFLAGS += -frtti -fexceptions
    ```
 
    The code compiles successfully with [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html?hl=ml), Revision 9 - 11 (and possibly later) and [CrystaX's Android NDK](https://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk) version 10.

- For GCC running on MinGW or Android SDK, the error `'to_string' is not a member of 'std'` (or similarly, for `strtod`) may occur. Note this is not an issue with the code,  but rather with the compiler itself. On Android, see above to build with a newer environment.  For MinGW, please refer to [this site](http://tehsausage.com/mingw-to-string) and [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/136) for information on how to fix this bug. For Android NDK using `APP_STL := gnustl_static`, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/219).

The following compilers are currently used in continuous integration at [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/nlohmann/json) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nlohmann/json):

## Projects using JSON for Modern C++

The library is currently used in Apple macOS Sierra and iOS 10. I am not sure what they are using the library for, but I am happy that it runs on so many devices.


## Notes

- The code contains numerous debug **assertions** which can be switched off by defining the preprocessor macro `NDEBUG`, see the [documentation of `assert`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert). In particular, note [`operator[]`](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a2e26bd0b0168abb61f67ad5bcd5b9fa1.html#a2e26bd0b0168abb61f67ad5bcd5b9fa1) implements **unchecked access** for const objects: If the given key is not present, the behavior is undefined (think of a dereferenced null pointer) and yields an [assertion failure](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/289) if assertions are switched on. If you are not sure whether an element in an object exists, use checked access with the [`at()` function](https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a674de1ee73e6bf4843fc5dc1351fb726.html#a674de1ee73e6bf4843fc5dc1351fb726).
- As the exact type of a number is not defined in the [JSON specification](http://rfc7159.net/rfc7159), this library tries to choose the best fitting C++ number type automatically. As a result, the type `double` may be used to store numbers which may yield [**floating-point exceptions**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/181) in certain rare situations if floating-point exceptions have been unmasked in the calling code. These exceptions are not caused by the library and need to be fixed in the calling code, such as by re-masking the exceptions prior to calling library functions.
- The library supports **Unicode input** as follows:
  - Only **UTF-8** encoded input is supported which is the default encoding for JSON according to [RFC 7159](http://rfc7159.net/rfc7159#rfc.section.8.1).
  - Other encodings such as Latin-1, UTF-16, or UTF-32 are not supported and will yield parse or serialization errors.
  - [Unicode noncharacters](http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar1) will not be replaced by the library.
  - Invalid surrogates (e.g., incomplete pairs such as `\uDEAD`) will yield parse errors.
  - The strings stored in the library are UTF-8 encoded. When using the default string type (`std::string`), note that its length/size functions return the number of stored bytes rather than the number of characters or glyphs.
- The code can be compiled without C++ **runtime type identification** features; that is, you can use the `-fno-rtti` compiler flag.
- **Exceptions** are used widely within the library. They can, however, be switched off with either using the compiler flag `-fno-exceptions` or by defining the symbol `JSON_NOEXCEPTION`. In this case, exceptions are replaced by an `abort()` call.
- By default, the library does not preserve the **insertion order of object elements**. This is standards-compliant, as the [JSON standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159.html) defines objects as "an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs". If you do want to preserve the insertion order, you can specialize the object type with containers like [`tsl::ordered_map`](https://github.com/Tessil/ordered-map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/546#issuecomment-304447518)) or [`nlohmann::fifo_map`](https://github.com/nlohmann/fifo_map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/485#issuecomment-333652309)).


## Execute unit tests

To compile and run the tests, you need to execute

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ ctest --output-on-failure
```
